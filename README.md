## Maintainer Guide

Formulae for Python projects are generated from templates in `Template/`, which simplify the `pip` and virtual environment setup of `pip`-installable projects.

Edit templates in `Template/` - formulae in `Formula/` are auto-generated.

### Updating for New Releases

Go to Actions → Update Formula → Run workflow

This updates the formula to the latest PyPI version and commits it.
